This project was made as an assignment for the course {\itshape Métodos de Programação 1} (Programming Methods 101), Computing Department, UnB, April 22nd, 2017. It consists in a library to convert Roman numbers to their integer values.

See the \hyperlink{md_README}{R\+E\+A\+D\+ME} for details about how to build, run and test the library and a little explanation about the inner workings of the Roman numbers.

\subsection*{Development }

I used the test-\/driven development (T\+DD) for the coding of this library. The tests were coded (and then the needed code to satisfy them) and developed as in the sucession below\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \hyperlink{md_doc_testSimple}{test\+Simple}, where I check if basic input strings are correctly handled.
\item \hyperlink{md_doc_testIncreasing}{test\+Increasing}, where I check if the case in which we have only increasing algarisms.
\item \hyperlink{md_doc_testSubtracting}{test\+Subtracting}, where I check the case for subtracting algarisms, i.\+e., IV or XM.
\item \hyperlink{md_doc_testUntil3000}{test\+Until3000}, where I check from a list from 1 to 3000.
\item \hyperlink{md_doc_testBin}{test\+Bin}, where I check the standalone binary for inconsistencies.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The final version of the code library can be found in \hyperlink{roman_8c}{src/roman.\+c} and in \hyperlink{roman-to-int_8c}{src/roman-\/to-\/int.\+c} , the final version of the standalone binary.

\subsection*{Test code coverage }

I then checked the test coverage using the gcov tool, yielding the following results\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
gcov obj/roman.o
File \textcolor{stringliteral}{'src/roman.c'}
Lines executed:100.00% of 64
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}
gcov obj/roman-to-\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}.o
File \textcolor{stringliteral}{'src/roman-to-int.c'}
Lines executed:90.48% of 21
\end{DoxyCode}


In the \hyperlink{roman-to-int_8c}{src/roman-\/to-\/int.\+c} file, the non-\/executed lines are referring to the check in case malloc() fails, which is a very unlikely case.


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordflow}{if}(arg\_str == NULL) \{
    fprintf(stderr, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Couldn't allocate memory.\(\backslash\)n"});
    \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} 1;
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


The corresponding .gcov files can be found in the following links\+: roman.\+c.\+gcov and roman-\/to-\/int.\+c.\+gcov

\subsection*{Static analysis }

I ran the command {\ttfamily cppcheck -\/-\/enable=warning .} in the source code directory, obtaining the following results\+:
